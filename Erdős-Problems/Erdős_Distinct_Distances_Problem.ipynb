        "# Erdős Distinct Distances Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The Erdős distinct distances problem is a famous problem in combinatorial geometry, posed by Paul Erdős in 1946. It asks for the minimum number of distinct distances determined by a set of n points in the plane.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "For a set P of n points in the plane, let g(P) denote the number of distinct distances between pairs of points in P. What is the minimum possible value of g(P) over all such sets P?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Distinct distance**: The number of unique distances between pairs of points in a set.\n",
        "- **Point set**: A collection of points in the plane.\n",
        "- **Asymptotic behavior**: The growth rate of the minimum number of distinct distances as n increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## History\n",
        "The problem was posed by Paul Erdős in 1946. Erdős conjectured that the minimum number of distinct distances is Ω(n / sqrt(log n)), and this was proven by Larry Guth and Nets Katz in 2010.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples\n",
        "- For n = 4 points forming a square: The distinct distances are the side length and the diagonal, so g(P) = 2.\n",
        "- For n = 5 points forming a regular pentagon: All distances are distinct, so g(P) = 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Known Results\n",
        "- **Erdős' conjecture** (1946): The minimum number of distinct distances is Ω(n / sqrt(log n)).\n",
        "- **Guth-Katz theorem** (2010): Proved that the minimum number of distinct distances is Ω(n / sqrt(log n)).\n",
        "- **Lower bound**: The current best lower bound is Ω(n / sqrt(log n)).\n",
        "- **Upper bound**: The current best upper bound is O(n / sqrt(log n)), achieved by the integer lattice.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Proof Idea\n",
        "Guth and Katz's proof uses techniques from algebraic geometry, including the polynomial method and incidence geometry. They bound the number of similar triangles in the plane, which relates to the number of distinct distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generalizations\n",
        "- The problem has been generalized to higher dimensions.\n",
        "- There are versions for other metrics, such as the Manhattan distance.\n",
        "- The concept has been extended to other combinatorial structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications\n",
        "- Computational geometry: In algorithms for proximity problems.\n",
        "- Coding theory: In the design of codes with specific distance properties.\n",
        "- Computer vision: In feature matching and object recognition.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 概述\n",
        "厄尔多斯不同距离问题是组合几何中的一个著名问题，由保罗·厄尔多斯于1946年提出。它询问平面上n个点所确定的不同距离的最小数量。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 问题陈述\n",
        "对于平面上的一组n个点P，设g(P)表示P中点对之间的不同距离的数量。在所有这样的集合P中，g(P)的最小可能值是多少？\n",
        "\n",
        "## 关键概念\n",
        "- **不同距离**：点集中点对之间的唯一距离的数量。\n",
        "- **点集**：平面上的一组点。\n",
        "- **渐近行为**：随着n增加，最小不同距离数量的增长率。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 历史\n",
        "该问题由保罗·厄尔多斯于1946年提出。厄尔多斯猜想最小不同距离数量为Ω(n / sqrt(log n))，这一猜想在2010年由拉里·古思和内茨·卡茨证明。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 例子\n",
        "- 对于形成正方形的n = 4个点：不同距离是边长和对角线，因此g(P) = 2。\n",
        "- 对于形成正五边形的n = 5个点：所有距离都不同，因此g(P) = 5。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 已知结果\n",
        "- **厄尔多斯猜想**（1946）：最小不同距离数量为Ω(n / sqrt(log n))。\n",
        "- **古思-卡茨定理**（2010）：证明了最小不同距离数量为Ω(n / sqrt(log n))。\n",
        "- **下界**：当前最佳下界为Ω(n / sqrt(log n))。\n",
        "- **上界**：当前最佳上界为O(n / sqrt(log n))，由整数格点实现。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 证明思路\n",
        "古思和卡茨的证明使用了代数几何技术，包括多项式方法和 incidence 几何。他们限制了平面中相似三角形的数量，这与不同距离的数量有关。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 推广\n",
        "- 该问题已被推广到更高维度。\n",
        "- 存在适用于其他度量的版本，如曼哈顿距离。\n",
        "- 该概念已被扩展到其他组合结构。\n",
        "\n",
