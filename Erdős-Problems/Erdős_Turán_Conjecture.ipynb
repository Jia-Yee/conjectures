        "# Erdős–Turán Conjecture\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The Erdős–Turán conjecture is an important problem in additive number theory, proposed by Paul Erdős and Pál Turán in 1941. It deals with the distribution of additive bases in the natural numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "For an additive basis \\( A \\) of order \\( h \\) (every natural number can be expressed as the sum of at most \\( h \\) elements of \\( A \\)), the representation function \\( r_A(n) \\) (the number of ways to express \\( n \\) as the sum of \\( h \\) elements of \\( A \\)) satisfies \\( r_A(n) = \\Omega(\\log n) \\) for infinitely many \\( n \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Additive basis**: A set \\( A \\) of natural numbers such that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of at most \\( h \\) elements of \\( A \\).\n",
        "- **Representation function**: The function \\( r_A(n) \\) counting the number of ways to express \\( n \\) as the sum of \\( h \\) elements of \\( A \\).\n",
        "- **Asymptotic notation**: \\( f(n) = \\Omega(g(n)) \\) means \\( f(n) \\) grows at least as fast as \\( g(n) \\) for large \\( n \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "## History\n",
        "The conjecture was proposed by Paul Erdős and Pál Turán in 1941. It has been extensively studied but remains unsolved in general, though partial results have been obtained for specific cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples\n",
        "- **Additive basis of order 2**: The set of squares (Lagrange's four-square theorem is a related result).\n",
        "- **Additive basis of order 1**: The set of all natural numbers (trivial case).\n",
        "- **Thin bases**: Bases with slow growth rate, where the representation function is small.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Known Results\n",
        "- **For order 2**: The conjecture is known to hold (proven by Erdős and Turán).\n",
        "- **For higher orders**: Partial results exist, but the general case remains open.\n",
        "- **Lower bounds**: Various lower bounds on representation functions have been established.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Proof Idea\n",
        "The conjecture suggests that any additive basis must have a representation function that grows at least logarithmically for infinitely many numbers. This would imply that no additive basis can be too 'thin' in terms of its representation function.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generalizations\n",
        "- The conjecture has been generalized to other algebraic structures.\n",
        "- There are versions for restricted sumsets and weighted sums.\n",
        "- The concept has been extended to other number systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications\n",
        "- Additive number theory: In the study of additive bases and representation functions.\n",
        "- Combinatorics: In problems related to set addition.\n",
        "- Computer science: In the design of algorithms for subset sum problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 历史\n",
        "该猜想由保罗·厄尔多斯和帕尔·图兰于1941年提出。它已被广泛研究，但在一般情况下仍未解决，尽管对于特定情况已获得部分结果。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 例子\n",
        "- **2阶加法基**：平方数集合（拉格朗日四平方定理是一个相关结果）。\n",
        "- **1阶加法基**：所有自然数的集合（平凡情况）。\n",
        "- **薄基**：表示函数较小的基，增长速度较慢。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 已知结果\n",
        "- **对于2阶**：猜想已知成立（由厄尔多斯和图兰证明）。\n",
        "- **对于高阶**：存在部分结果，但一般情况仍未解决。\n",
        "- **下界**：已经建立了表示函数的各种下界。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 证明思路\n",
        "猜想表明，任何加法基的表示函数必须对于无限多个数至少以对数速度增长。这意味着没有加法基在表示函数方面可以太'薄'。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 推广\n",
        "- 该猜想已被推广到其他代数结构。\n",
