        "# Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv Theorem\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem is a fundamental result in additive combinatorics, proven by Paul Erdős, Abraham Ginzburg, and Abraham Ziv in 1961. This theorem deals with the problem of finding subsets of numbers that sum to a multiple of a given integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theorem Statement\n",
        "For any set of 2n-1 integers, there exists a subset of n integers whose sum is divisible by n.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Additive combinatorics**: A branch of combinatorics dealing with properties of sets and their sums.\n",
        "- **Subset sum problem**: The problem of finding a subset of numbers that sum to a specific value.\n",
        "- **Divisibility**: A central concept in number theory, where one integer is divisible by another if the remainder is zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "## History\n",
        "The theorem was proven by Paul Erdős, Abraham Ginzburg, and Abraham Ziv in 1961. It has since become a cornerstone result in additive combinatorics, with many generalizations and applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples\n",
        "- For n = 2: Given any 3 integers, there exists a subset of 2 integers whose sum is even.\n",
        "- For n = 3: Given any 5 integers, there exists a subset of 3 integers whose sum is divisible by 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Proof Idea\n",
        "The original proof uses induction on the number of prime factors of n. For prime p, it uses the pigeonhole principle and properties of finite fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generalizations\n",
        "- The theorem has been generalized to other abelian groups.\n",
        "- There are versions for non-abelian groups.\n",
        "- The concept has been extended to other algebraic structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications\n",
        "- Coding theory: In the design of error-correcting codes.\n",
        "- Cryptography: In certain cryptographic protocols.\n",
