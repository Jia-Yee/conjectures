        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The Erdős–Szekeres theorem is a classic result in combinatorial geometry, proved by Paul Erdős and George Szekeres in 1935. It deals with the existence of convex polygons in sets of points in the plane.\n",

        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "### English Statement\n",
        "For any positive integer $k \\geq 3$, there exists a smallest positive integer $N(k)$ such that any set of $N(k)$ points in the plane, no three of which are collinear, contains a subset of $k$ points that form a convex $k$-gon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 中文问题定义\n",
        "对于任意正整数 $k \\geq 3$，存在最小的正整数 $N(k)$，使得平面上任意 $N(k)$ 个点（其中没有三点共线）中，必然包含一个由 $k$ 个点组成的凸 $k$ 边形。\n",
