        "# Erdős–Szemerédi Theorem\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The Erdős–Szemerédi theorem is an important result in combinatorics, proven by Paul Erdős and Endre Szemerédi in 1983. It establishes a relationship between the size of a set and the number of distinct sums and products it contains.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theorem Statement\n",
        "For any set \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) integers, the number of distinct sums or the number of distinct products is at least \\(n^{1 + \\epsilon}\\) for some \\(\\epsilon > 0\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Distinct sums**: The number of unique values obtained by adding pairs of elements from the set.\n",
        "- **Distinct products**: The number of unique values obtained by multiplying pairs of elements from the set.\n",
        "- **Growth rate**: The rate at which the number of distinct sums or products increases as the size of the set increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## History\n",
        "The theorem was proven by Paul Erdős and Endre Szemerédi in 1983. It was a significant breakthrough in additive combinatorics, addressing a problem that had been open for many years.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples\n",
        "- For the set \\(A = \\left\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\right\\}\\):\n",
        "  - Distinct sums: \\(3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\) (5 distinct sums)\n",
        "  - Distinct products: \\(2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12\\) (6 distinct products)\n",
        "- For the set \\(A = \\left\\{1, 2, 4, 8\\right\\}\\):\n",
        "  - Distinct sums: \\(3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12\\) (6 distinct sums)\n",
        "  - Distinct products: \\(2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\) (6 distinct products)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Known Results\n",
        "- **Original theorem** (1983): Erdős and Szemerédi proved that either the number of distinct sums or the number of distinct products is at least \\(n^{1 + \\epsilon}\\) for some small \\(\\epsilon > 0\\).\n",
        "- **Current best bound**: The best known value of \\(\\epsilon\\) is approximately 0.01, proven by Solymosi in 2009.\n",
        "- **Conjecture**: It is conjectured that the number of distinct sums or products is at least \\(n^{2 - o(1)}\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Proof Idea\n",
        "The original proof uses a combination of combinatorial arguments and estimates from additive number theory. It involves analyzing the structure of sets with few distinct sums or products and showing that such sets cannot be too large.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generalizations\n",
        "- The theorem has been generalized to other algebraic structures, such as finite fields.\n",
        "- There are versions for higher-dimensional sums and products.\n",
        "- The concept has been extended to other binary operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications\n",
        "- Additive combinatorics: In the study of sumsets and product sets.\n",
        "- Number theory: In problems related to multiplicative functions.\n",
        "- Computer science: In the design of algorithms for set operations.\n",

        "## 概述\n",
        "厄尔多斯-塞迈雷迪定理是组合数学中的一个重要结果，由保罗·厄尔多斯和安德烈·塞迈雷迪于1983年证明。它建立了集合大小与它包含的不同和与积数量之间的关系。\n",

        "- **不同积**：通过从集合中乘以元素对获得的唯一值的数量。\n",
        "- **增长率**：随着集合大小增加，不同和或积的数量增加的速率。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 历史\n",
        "该定理由保罗·厄尔多斯和安德烈·塞迈雷迪于1983年证明。它是加法组合数学中的重大突破，解决了一个多年未解决的问题。\n",

        "\n",
        "## 证明思路\n",
        "原始证明使用了组合论证和加法数论估计的组合。它涉及分析具有少量不同和或积的集合的结构，并表明这样的集合不能太大。\n",
        "\n",
        "## 推广\n",
