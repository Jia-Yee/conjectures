        "\n",
        "The Green-Tao theorem is a landmark result in number theory, proven by Ben Green and Terence Tao in 2004. It resolves a long-standing conjecture by Paul Erdős regarding the existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the prime numbers.\n",

        "- **1770**: Lagrange and Waring proved that there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression $4n+1$ and $4n+3$.\n",
        "- **1837**: Dirichlet proved that any arithmetic progression $an+b$ with $a$ and $b$ coprime contains infinitely many primes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Contributions\n",
        "- **1939**: van der Corput proved that there are infinitely many arithmetic progressions of length 3 in the primes.\n",
        "- **1981**: Erdős offered a $10,000 prize for a proof that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.\n",
        "- **1999**: Green proved that the primes contain infinitely many arithmetic progressions of length 4.\n",
        "- **2004**: Green and Tao proved the full conjecture, showing that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.\n",
        "- **2006**: Tao was awarded the Fields Medal in part for his work on the Green-Tao theorem."

        "3. **Gowers Norms**: The proof uses Gowers uniformity norms to quantify the pseudorandomness of a set, which is crucial for applying the relative Szemerédi theorem.\n",
