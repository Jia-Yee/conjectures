    "# Erdős–Straus Conjecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Erdős–Straus conjecture, proposed in 1948 by Paul Erdős and Ernst G. Straus, is an unsolved problem in number theory. It deals with expressing fractions as sums of unit fractions, which are fractions with a numerator of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conjecture Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For every integer $n \\geq 2$, the fraction $\\frac{4}{n}$ can be expressed as the sum of three positive unit fractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{4}{n} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x, y, z$ are positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While verified computationally for $n$ up to $10^{17}$, a general proof remains elusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some specific examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For $n = 2$: $\\frac{4}{2} = 2 = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- For $n = 3$: $\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{12}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- For $n = 4$: $\\frac{4}{4} = 1 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- For $n = 5$: $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{20}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- For $n = 6$: $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{42}$"

    "\n",
    "It is sufficient to prove the conjecture for prime numbers $n$, as the result can be extended to composite numbers. This is because if $n$ is composite, we can express $\\frac{4}{n}$ in terms of unit fractions by first considering its prime factors."
